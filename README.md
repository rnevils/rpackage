STAT 431 lab 4 package


To use this package you need a YouTube API key. See [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) for how to get a key.

The `comment_cloud` function also needs a Youtube video ID. To find the Id of a youtube video look at the url and find the last part after the **v=**

For example in `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjA5faZF1A8` the Id would be `QjA5faZF1A8`
