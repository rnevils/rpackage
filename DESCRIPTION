Description:This package uses the YouTube API to conveniently access, clean, analyze and visualize attributes of the current most popular YouTube videos and comments for a specific video. 
            This enables YouTube both video creators and non-creators to easily query and study trends among the most popular videos (such as titles, genres, comments). 
            For creators, this insight can lead to data-driven decisions to improve future production and marketing efforts for their YouTube channel.
